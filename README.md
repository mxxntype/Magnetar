### Idea ðŸŒ¾
I wanted to create a modpack that would expand on a lot of aspects of the game in a vanilla-friendly fashion, without breaking immersion and making the entire thing look like a giant pile of mods thrown together with barely any integration. Here's an overview of the things I wanted to expand upon:

- **Aesthetic technology** via [Create]() & [Ad Astra]()
- A **cozy & diverse world** via [Tectonic](), [Continents]() & [Funky Flora]()
- **Building & decorations** via [Chipped](), [Handcrafted]() & [Supplementaries]()
- More **immersive combat** via [Better Combat]()
- **Performance** and **looks** via [Sodium]() & [Iris]()

And there is so much more... take a look at the `mods` folder.
